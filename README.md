# Sample Machine Learning Service

This is a sample machine learning service that can provide machine learned predictions for a sample application. 

The code is a modification of the Qwiklabs code lab [Learning TensorFlow: the Hello World of Machine Learning](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/7639?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A2%2C%22num_filters%22%3A1%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=3824914) to separate the training part from the prediction part and add an HTTP endpoint to serve predictions to clients.
